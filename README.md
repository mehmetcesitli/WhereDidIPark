# WhereDidIPark
An android application to store and find the location of a parked car.

This is a simple Android application developed on Android studio using Java. I developed it as my senior project of my bachelor studies.
It also helped me to discover the Android Studio environment and basics of mobile development.

Contains instances of:
- Object Oriented Programming with Java
- Retrieval of location information using Geolocation.
- Saving and using key-value pairs using shared preferences.

Feel free to use and improve it.
